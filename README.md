# Robocode

Robocode for Scala, including sbt tasks to compile and run


## Prerequisites

1. Scala 2.11 from [here](http://www.scala-lang.org/download/2.11.7.html) -- [help installing here](http://www.scala-lang.org/download/install.html) 
2. Activator (tricked-out SBT) [here](http://www.lightbend.com/activator/download)

## To create a robot

* Create yourself a new robot in `src/main/scala`
* `activator compile`
* `activator run`
* Select Battle->New
* Pick two robots
* Click `Start Battle` and see who is victorious.

## Hints

You can see examples of robots in Java under `src/main/java`.

Feel free to familiarize yourself with strategies used there and implement them in Scala, but bonus points for doing something utterly original.
